# Intro_to_Visualizations
Final Project

This project outlines a service named Healthy Browsing that takes keywords and metadata from your web browser history and restructures it to provide visualizations that show how what you read compares to clinical assessments in anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and social determinants of health. For the purpose of this project, a student's web browsing history was used.
