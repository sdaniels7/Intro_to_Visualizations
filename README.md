# Intro_to_Visualizations
Final Project

This project outlines a service named Healthy Browsing that takes keywords and metadata from your web browser history and restructures it to provide visualizations that show how what you read compares to clinical assessments in anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and social determinants of health. For the purpose of this project, a student's web browsing history was used.

There are four charts:

(1) Linegraph of the average keyword counts by Anxiety, Depression, Social Factors, and Substance Abuse per month requires the following data:
 -SDoH keyword count
 -Anxiety keyword count
 -Depression keyword count
 -CAGEAID keyword count
 -Date website is accessed

 (2) Bubble chart of keywords with number of hits representing their size by month, requiring the following: 
 -SDoH keyword count
 -Anxiety keyword count
 -Depression keyword count
 -CAGEAID keyword count
 -Date website is accessed

 (3) Top websites over time
 -Webpage
 -Time spent on page
 -Date accessed

 (4) Web browsing by time of day
