# Intro_to_Visualizations
Final Project

This project outlines a service named Healthy Browsing that takes keywords and metadata from your web browser history and restructures it to provide visualizations that show how what you read compares to clinical assessments in anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and social determinants of health. For the purpose of this project, a student's web browsing history was used.

There are four charts:

(1) Linegraph of the average keyword counts by Anxiety, Depression, Social Factors, and Substance Abuse per month requires the following data:
 -SDoH keyword count
 -Anxiety keyword count
 -Depression keyword count
 -CAGEAID keyword count
 -Date website is accessed

 (2) Bubble chart of keywords with number of hits representing their size by month, requiring the following: 
 -SDoH keyword count
 -Anxiety keyword count
 -Depression keyword count
 -CAGEAID keyword count
 -Date website is accessed

 (3) Top websites over time
 -Webpage
 -Time spent on page
 -Date accessed

 (4) Web browsing by time of day
  -SDoH keyword count
 -Anxiety keyword count
 -Depression keyword count
 -CAGEAID keyword count
 -Hour accessed

List of lessons learned
 This project was harder than I anticipated, and it started creating the Python script. I did not  anticipate so many issues with using BeautifulSoup for webcrawling, specific the limitations on how many times I could run the scripts before the webpages may deny new requests. 

 

Part 1 

Submit your high-fidelity prototypes. This is an iteration on your P2 assignment. The expectation is a simplified version of P2 which includes high fidelity designs (created in Figma, Google Draw, etc). You should get feedback on these designs from others in the class, the teaching staff, and others outside the class. Spending a little extra time to get these designs right will save you lots of time down the road with costly changes to your visualization.

Part 2 

Submit a link to your Github repository. Send a short PDF that includes your progress to this point and any challenges that could prevent you from fully developing your application as described in Part 1. If you have made any updates to your designs or ideas, please highlight those changes as well. The goal of this submission is to ensure that you are making good progress on your project. 

Part 3 

This is the final submission deadline for your projects. At this time, you must submit a link to your GitHub Repository where you are running your code (via Github Pages). You do not need to submit a report, but your repository should have a readme with
