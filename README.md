# Intro_to_Visualizations
## Final Project

###Summmary
This project outlines a service named Healthy Browsing that takes keywords and metadata from your web browser history and restructures it to provide visualizations that show how what you read compares to clinical assessments in anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and social determinants of health. For the purpose of this project, a student's web browsing history was used.

There are four charts:

(1) Linegraph of the average keyword counts by Anxiety, Depression, Social Factors, and Substance Abuse per month requires the following data:
 -SDoH keyword count
 -Anxiety keyword count
 -Depression keyword count
 -CAGEAID keyword count
 -Date website is accessed

 (2) Bubble chart of keywords with number of hits representing their size by month, requiring the following: 
 -SDoH keyword count
 -Anxiety keyword count
 -Depression keyword count
 -CAGEAID keyword count
 -Date website is accessed

 (3) Top websites over time
 -Webpage
 -Time spent on page
 -Date accessed

 (4) Web browsing by time of day
  -SDoH keyword count
 -Anxiety keyword count
 -Depression keyword count
 -CAGEAID keyword count
 -Hour accessed

### List of lessons learned
 This project was harder than I anticipated, and it started creating the Python script. I did not  anticipate so many issues with using BeautifulSoup for webcrawling, specific the limitations on how many times I could run the scripts before the webpages may deny new requests. 

 I found that organization was my best friend throughout this project. With unorganized code, I frequently found that I had declared a variable then written over it, creating chaos in the visualizations. I was unfamiliar with the github platform ad I found previewing my webpage to be especially time consuming.
